The Forgotten CMS
In the year 2045, a rogue AI has taken over the world's digital infrastructure. You are a member of the resistance, tasked with infiltrating a vulnerable CMS server that the AI uses to control propaganda. Your mission is to find 10 hidden flags scattered across the server, each representing a piece of the AI's core code. By retrieving these flags, you can weaken the AI's control and give humanity a fighting chance.
